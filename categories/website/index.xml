      <description>There are many options for maintaining a website these days. There are free options on blogger and WordPress, all the way up to premium services. I hosted this site on Squarespace for many years. The service is good but their templates selection was lacking for a tech blog. I was also underwhelmed with their editor&amp;rsquo;s performance and it is fairly expensive. I set a goal to migrate my website onto another service to both reduce the cost to maintain and to make it a little easier to update if I am offline.</description>
