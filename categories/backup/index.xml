      <description>On January 31, 2017 Gitlab experienced a massive database outage. They suffered hours of downtime, which they have detailed here.

It&amp;rsquo;s not easy to put yourself on display, warts and all. Second, there are so many self inflicted wounds and unforced errors in the story.</description>
