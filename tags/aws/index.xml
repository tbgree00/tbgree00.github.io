      <description>The end of the calendar year brings family, travel, and performance evaluations. A big part of mine is training and tech development. It&amp;rsquo;s never too soon to start thinking about what is new and where your are interested in strengthening your skill.
I asked some tech experts what skills are the stuff to learn for 2017. Keith Townsend @ctoadvisor responded with
 Scripting (ie Cloud Formation, Powershell, Python)
Hybrid infrastructure networking (AWS VPC&amp;gt;VPN integration)</description>

      <description>Discussion of the cloud seems to be popping up around me daily. Part of it is my own instigation but other people are starting the discussions as well. It is always a lively debate with three sides. There&amp;rsquo;s very pro-cloud, cloud for specific use cases, and there are the totally anti-cloud people.

      <description>About two years ago I just happened to read an article in CIO magazine about &amp;ldquo;The Cloud&amp;rdquo;. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a huge fan of virtualization and getting the most computing for my money. Reading about AWS in particular really excited me. I thought of Amazon as a fantastic retailer and this article and the research done afterward really opened my eyes.
I&amp;rsquo;m all about infrastructure and approached my studies from that perspective.</description>
