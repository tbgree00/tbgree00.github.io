      <description>VMworld is one of the most anticipated events of the year for many people in the tech world. Engineers and architects from all over the world come together to share, learn, and make new friends. I have been fortunate enough to attend both VMworld 2016 and 2017 and have learned many lessons about how to maximize my time.
There are a few tips you&amp;rsquo;ll read over and over again. They are definitely worth repeating, though.</description>

The experience causes me a lot of anxiety. Being good at an interview is a skill. The key to mastering any skill is practice, so I asked my fellow vBrownBag crewmates to help me with a mock interview. Rebecca Fitzhugh agreed to help out and we recorded it for the vBrownBag podcast</description>
