      <description>On January 31, 2017 Gitlab experienced a massive database outage. They suffered hours of downtime, which they have detailed here. The transparency in that link is breathtaking for a couple reasons. First, any company willing to details their failures and challenges in such public terms gets my kudos. It&amp;rsquo;s not easy to put yourself on display, warts and all. Second, there are so many self inflicted wounds and unforced errors in the story.</description>

      <description>Next up in my Tech Field Day 13 research is Veeam. Itâ€™s hard to talk about enterprise backup without discussing Veeam. Founded in 2006, Veeam was among the first to solve the challenge presented by backing up virtual machines. As the years have passed they continued to improve and add features to their product. It was just announced that in 2016 they saw 28% growth. That is remarkable growth for any company, especially if they have been around for 10 years.</description>
