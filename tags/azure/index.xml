      <description>In my article about creating an Azure virtual machine, I walked us through the very basic wizard to create a VM. There is an entire segment of the virtual machine build process dedicated to optional features. These features allow new virtual machines to integrate a VM into an existing Azure environment. When we created our first machine we accepted the default settings, which created new network and storage accounts. That works perfectly for a first look but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be appropriate for use in a real life Azure Infrastructure.</description>

      <description>One of the most basic tasks a VMware administrator will perform is deploying a virtual machine. Whether it is creating a VM from scratch or using a template, we&amp;rsquo;ve all worked through the wizard.
As I dig deeper into Azure I can&amp;rsquo;t help but bring my experience with vSphere along with me. The Azure Resource Manger is a very different experience from the vSphere Web Client but there also quite a few similarities.</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Azure for Free</title>

      <description>I recently created a blog post about Getting Started with AWS. I like what they do and think they&amp;rsquo;re a great platform but there is more than one horse in the public cloud race. Microsoft Azure is a close second to AWS and getting better every day. Microsoft has many advantages that AWS doesn&amp;rsquo;t: They are probably already in your datacenter and you probably have an ELA with them. If you do, check and see if there are Azure credits in there.</description>
